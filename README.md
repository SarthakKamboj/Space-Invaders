## Introduction
This project is meant to be a recreation of the original Space Invaders game. The goal is to learn about the different systems of a game engine as well as implementing the game mechanics. I would like to explore the low-level programming aspects of the field, such as memory allocation, graphics APIs, physics/collision detection, etc. Overall, the aim is to develop a game while creating the technology from scratch. By the end of the project, I hope to have a game that is downloadable from the internet and can run on any computer running a Windows operating system and capable of running OpenGL.

As part of my learning, I am reading the Game Engine Architecture book by Jason Gregory. I will also be taking notes are storing them in the notes folder of this repository. I am also creating devlogs about the progress of my game as well as an overview of the concepts I have learned and issues I have encountered.
